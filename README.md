# BelmoCafeWebsite
MTC Berkeley's Inaugural Client Project (Spring 2023). Designed specifically for newer programmers to learn web development in 4 weeks, and to support small businesses in our community by developing free professional websites for them!

Belmo Cafe is an Algerian / French bakery in Berkeley, CA. We saw their website, and offered them to build them a new one for free! 
This is the beginging of MTC Berkeley's initiatives to leverage our skills and serve our community in any way we can :) Check them out at 1160 University Ave, Berkeley, CA.
